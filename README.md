# Machine-Learning-Classifications-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart Disease Machine Learning Analysis and Prediction
1. Applied 4 Type of Data Preprocessings: Raw, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and Log transform features for each model.
2. Implemented 10 classic Machine Learning models and one ANN model.
3. Implemented Plot_Learning_Curve, which can plot learning curves, scalability of the model and performance of the model.
4. There are 5 models the recall reached 93.5 % with the small sample size (303).
