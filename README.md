# Machine-Learning-Classifications-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction

Heart Disease Machine Learning Analysis and Prediction
1. Applied 4 Type of Data Preprocessings: Raw, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and Log transform features for each model.
2. Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost etc. classic Machine Learning models and ANN model.
3. Implemented Plot_Learning_Curve, which can plot learning curves, scalability of the model and performance of the model.
4. There are 5 models the recall reached 93.5 % with the small sample size (303).
